A full managemet system that implements GUI & OOP principles using java.
You can run the code in MainWindow class.
The system has two types of access; an admin role and employees role.

For The Admin Role:
After logging in, they have access to employees data "ID,Name,Email,Address,Phone Number" (add & remove employee, view employees) and of course logout.
these options are represented as buttons and each button is responsible for its window. the app has the following features in GUI:
• If the user clicks the button Add Employee, this window disappears and the add Employee window appears.the code also checks if the employee already exists or not.
• If the user clicks the button View Employees, this window disappears and the view Employees window appears.  
• If the user clicks the button Remove Employee, this window disappears and the remove Employee window appears.he code also checks if the employee already exists or not.  
• If the user clicks the button Logout, this window disappears and the Inventory System window reappears.  
The user can’t close this window from the X button. The only way is to click the button Logout. if the user clicks the button Logout, then the list of Employee users should be saved to the file "Employees.txt" and the window disappears and the Inventory System main window reappears.
A pop message appears if any data isn't written fully or correctly.

For The Employee Role:
